# Windows automation

A short compendium of tools and articles used in one-day automation workshop we used @work - so it can be expanded in future.

Recently during a one-day long workshop at work we succesfully automated entire process of Windows OS image creation, installation and provisioning, from the very fresh `.iso` installation file up to typing `vagrant rdp` to automatically log into fully provisioned system. The list of usefull tools and readings used during that workshop will be included here.
In the future the list will be updated, as we will be using and adding our own PowerShell provisioning scripts.
